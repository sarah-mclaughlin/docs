## Sidebar
The most important part of navigation is the __Sidebar__ allowing you control of what and where to display the toolset needed for your development.

The options available in the Sidebar are the following:
* [__Component-Tree__](#component-tree)
* [__Class Editor__](#class-editor)
* [__Style Editor__](#style-editor)
* [__Component Settings__](#component-settings)
* [__Props Flow__](#props-flow)
* [__Timeline__](timeline.md)
* [__Export Manager__](exporting.md#export-manager)
* [__Profile__](dashboard.md#profile)

## Component-Tree

Using a hierarchical structure, the component-tree provides a visual overview of how components are linked. It's the easiest way to keep track of structure and to apply changes to each Shift Component. It also provides a easy-to-use creation tool to create new __Components__ of a list of __Shift Components__ and __HTML Elements__ for quicker development and drag'n'drop feature that allows you to re-structure and organise your app.

## Class Editor
"The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements" - MDN
In the Shift's paradigm, classes work exactly on the same principle. It enables the re-use of code, being it CSS or JS.

## Style Editor

The Style Editor is a set of tools that allows you to control and customize every aspect of styling. With the visual help of Canvas you can see in real-time all the styling being applied.

* Select the __Component Settings__ panel from the sidebar

## State Settings
The __State Settings__ panel is responsible for the configuration and updated information of __State__ in the selected component.


For more information on __State Settings__ please refer to the [__State__](state.md) section.

### Access State Settings panel
* Inside the __Builder__ select a component from the __Component Tree__
* Select the __State Settings__ panel from the sidebar


## Props Flow
All you need to manipulate how __Props__ flow between components is shown and selected in the __Props Flow__ panel.

For more information on __Props Flow__ please refer to the [__Props__](props.md) section.

### Access Props Flow panel

## Content-Area
With its own tab management system, __Shift__ lets the user manage and customize it's dev environment like any other IDE. With a key differenciation between two types of Tabs being them __Canvas__ and __Code__ tabs.

### Canvas Tabs
All the changes from styling, interaction, data presentation, and others are shown here in real-time without the need to press a Save button.
Not only it will give you a visual state of your app, it is also an easy way to structure, place and re-organize all your visual components by __dragging__ them into it. With labels, highlights, routing and ruler it will also help you to be more aware of the whole procedure. 

For more information on [__Canvas__](canvas.md) please refer to its section.

### Code Tabs
For coding and configuration purposes we have the __Code Tabs__ that enable you to edit any Action, Event, Stylesheet, Props and entire components with the same tools as an IDE.

### Drag'n'Drop
In the Content-Area one of the most useful tools is the drag'n'drop. It is possible for you to drag to structure, re-adjust everything from __windows__, __components__, __tabs__, __elements__, __code__ and others just by dragging them into place

## Real-time Collaboration

One of the key features of Shift is the collaboration in real-time. Coding and Designing can be done at the same time, remotely and always keeping each operation's order.
This will shortcut through web-app development limitations we know to be real in a every day's work, bringing different variables to take in consideration for a whole new environment where communication is key.
