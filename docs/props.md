`Props is shorthand for properties. Props are how components talk to each other. `

It is possible to customize components with different properties when they are created and these are called __Props__. This enables the creation of the same component with different properties reusing it for different ends.

If you’re not at all familiar with __React__ you should know that __Props__ flow from a parent component downwards to it's children.

If a parent component doesn't pass __Props__ you can always have default props set.

__Props__ are used to pass data from parent to child or by the component itself and are immutable and thus will not be changed.
