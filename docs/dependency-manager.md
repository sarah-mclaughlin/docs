The __Dependency Manager__ is as the name states, a dependency manager, for npm. Which means you can import and manage any package you need for better development. Enabling you control
over package versions and an installation even easier and quicker.

## Add a dependency
In the Depedency Manager you can search for a npm package from the __npm registry__ just by typing the package name. Then you set the package version you want in your project just like a [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file used for __npm config__.
<br> `ex: react-semantic-ui     ^0.2.0`

For default the last package version will be installed.
