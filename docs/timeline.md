What does happen a lot in development and life? __Mistakes__, so we got the development part covered.

Like any other __IDE__, Shift offers a __Undo/Redo__ feature, called __Timeline__. With navigation through the timeline of your project it is possible to rollback a previous version or even roll back to a rolled back operation, and it might get a lot more complex, but in a easy way to use.

With it's visual presentation you can:

* Verify if what you are rolling back got synced to server
* Check what the operation will do on rollback
* date and author of that operation.
